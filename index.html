        Hi there, my name is Aaron Keisler. I've always had a interest in
        computers and coding, but only recently began to take strong steps
        towards furthering my web development skillset. I've been focusing on
        Full Stack Javascript and the MERN (Mongo, Express, React, and Node)
        Stack. I also have some experience with Python and Visual Basic in Excel
        for some basic automation and scripting. To further add to my skillset,
        I am currently taking the Part-time Web Development Bootcamp through
        George Washington University.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside this course, I've been working my way through Wes Bos's
        Javascript30, ES6 for Beginners, and React for Beginners courses. I've
        combined this with a commitment to 100 Days of Code, though I've only
        been logging locally for now.
      </p>
      <p>
        My professional background is in Legal Technology and eDiscovery. Over 6
        years, I have gained experience with services such as Relativity (v8.2,
        v9.6, v9.7), One-O, Servient, Concordance, and others and enjoy
        employing various tactics to complete cleaning, parsing, and searching
        projects with produced data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please contact me via the form on this page (not yet operational) or my
        email if you have any questions or wish to discuss any potential
        projects.
